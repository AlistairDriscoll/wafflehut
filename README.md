## About

Wafflehut is a Reddit-style website that is all about people sharing their opinions, but with a sort of twist. Wafflehut is designed to be an environment where people can share and talk about their maybe more controversial opinions on things, and others can both comment, or use one of various reactions to express if they agree or disagree. I chose the name Wafflehut from an English slang word 'waffle'. If someone is talking nonsense then they might be told that they are 'talking absolute waffle' or that they are 'waffling on a bit'. In using this in the name of the website users can hopefully understand that you can say things in jest and banter with users for whatever they say also, hopefully adding a sense of camaraderie and jest to the user experience that one does not normally see on other sites.
