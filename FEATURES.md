# Wafflehut Features

In my website designs I had thought to make the website have a main home page dispaying posts for both registered users and non-registered users. Registered users then have the option to react to the posts and comment on them. Everytime the user posts or comments on a post their wafflescore will go up, which determines their waffle rank. A user also each has their own user page also available for all users to look at. This will display their waffle rank, and display their posts four to a page for desktop, moving down to only one post a page for mobile use, although the user will be able to scroll to see more. A 'could have' option is for the user to see a list of posts they have commented on previously in order to catch up with what other commenters have said in reply to them.

The wireframes I have sketched out are designed to have the main page display four random wafflehut posts that could be from any account and about anything. I decided this because I thought it would complement the premise of the app in that people are there to 'waffle on' for anyone to read about and I thought that by chance if people bumped into posts where people had the same opinion as them then it would enhance the social element that the app is supposed to provide, and if they disagreed the banter element would be enhanced also. Unfortunately the current product doesn't unclude all the details that are shown in the wireframes but I have mentioned some updates in the ![Future Improvements file link](FUTUREIMPROVEMENTS.md) that will hopefully be implemented soon.

An example of this is the above, as it has been stripped down a bit with the bottom picture being the end product flowchart.

### Register and Sign-in

The user can also go from the home page to the Signin/register pages where the user can quickly register by providing a username and password or sign in by putting their details in.

### Jumbotrons

There will be a jumbotron that pops up when the signed-in user presses the sign-out button. This will be to double check the users choice and therefore provide good UTX. The same happens for when the user goes to delete their account. The other jumbotron will pop up for the user when they go to add a post, providing all the data fields for them to fill out.

## Actual Features

![The Navbar](documentation/finished-content/navbar.jpg)

The navbar has classes to make the catchphrase and waffle logo dissapear when on medium and smaller screens respectively along with a class to make the links go to a red color when hovered over for UX. The typeface is a google font called 'East Sea Dokdo' which according to the website is supposed to look like straight brushes of a paintbrush. I chose this because to me I thought it actually looked like chalk writing which I thought suited the website rather well. As there is already an app called facebook and thought to apply that name concept to my project, I thought a hut is a likely place to make or fine waffle, and I further thought that a wafflehut would be the type of place to have a chalkboard displaying the menu.

### The Homescreen

![Homescreen](documentation/finished-content/homepage.jpg)

The homepage displays four random posts at a time. Authenticated users and non authenticated users will see the same content, and same available links to see the full post.

### The Userpage

![A userpage](documentation/finished-content/user-page.jpg)

The users details can be shown at the side with options to change them or delete their account if they would like. The user page also displays posts four-at-a-time, although this time they are in order and the user can go through all of them on extra pages.
